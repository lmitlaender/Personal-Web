## Who am I?
Hey there! <br/>
I'm Lutz Mitländer, currently a computer science bachelor's student, and unbelievably curious about all kinds of subjects. Whenever I see something interesting I just love to lose myself in it for hours on end, until my head is filled. This doesn't only include computer science subjects, other areas like Space are included too!

### My journey
My IT learning journey starts pretty early on, with both parents active in the sector and growing up surrounded by technology and video games.

The first time I remember programming is with ~12 - 14, creating my own little Minecraft server plugins in Java, researching for hours on end on youtube and learning the basics, getting active in some communities and building friendships with some more skilled coders over forums. From then on the journey has been a little all over the place. <br/> I proceeded to "steal" a C++ Book from my father, learning about memory, pointers, and all that good stuff. Got to know AutoIt for scripts and simple GUI programs. Basically, I was playing around and getting to know everything I could.

Then after 10th grade in middle school I stood before the choice: <br/>
 - Do I continue on to High school and afterwards to Study to get to know more of the theory?
 - Or do I serve an Apprenticeship to finally get some practical experience? 

In the end, it was clear: I wanted both. I wanted to know more but also to be able to work in a real-world programming environment. <br/>
So what was my solution to this dilemma? A nice little pilot project called "Vocational School Plus" (Berufsschule Plus), which enabled me to serve an Apprenticeship as a "Computer Science Expert in Software Development" and at the same time visit an evening school voluntarily, to get my high school diploma at the same time. It wasn't always the easiest but I ended up doing it!

And now here I am, studying computer science at the "Nuremberg Institute of Technology" while still working as a software engineer part-time.
