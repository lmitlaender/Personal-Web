That\u0026rsquo;s what you\u0026rsquo;re reading rn!)\nSo then after a little search.. here I am!\nIntroducing Hugo\u003e\rIntroducing Hugo # What is Hugo?\u003e\rWhat is Hugo? # Hugo is an open-source Static Site Generator (SSG) written in Go, created to make building websites fast, flexible and fun.\nAnd for now I have to say, I completely agree with that. To be fair I haven\u0026rsquo;t done anything special with it, just using a simple template and changing the settings to my needs, but it was absolutely fun and especially fast, except for a little DNS problem I had.\nFor example I\u0026rsquo;m just writing all of this little post in Markdown right now! With the help of a little HTML that is.\nHow does it work?\u003e\rHow does it work? # So it really is stupid simple to use:\nInstall Hugo Install Git Choose a Theme that\u0026rsquo;s to your liking (I used Blowfish) Follow their Quickstart Guide and customize your theme ??? Deploy -\u0026gt; Profit How did I deploy it?\u003e\rHow did I deploy it? # Deploying can be as easy or hard as you want to make it for yourself. They have a extensive Overview of how to Host and Deploy Hugo in a variety of popular ways right in their Documentation.\nAs to what I chose..\nGitHub \u0026amp; Netlify\u003e\rGitHub \u0026amp; Netlify # So the first step I took after creating the general outline of my site is push it to a GitHub Repository, feel free to check that out if you\u0026rsquo;re wondering how I configured some things.\nThen Deploying it, including a global CDN, continuous deployment, one-click SSL and a custom Domain, was as easy it gets. I basically only followed their Guide on how to Host on Netlify. In my case I had to set an Environment Variable for HUGO_VERSION = 0.107.0 as Netlify (and Cloudflare where I tried too) both didn\u0026rsquo;t use the newest version by default for some reason.\nLet it build for ~20s and - Your website is now live!\nAdding a custom domain\u003e\rAdding a custom domain # Now this is where I had some problems, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think I can blame them on Netlify (or Cloudflare where I tried too). Both of them give you very nice and simple to understand records you need to add to your domain DNS-Records. So far so good but..\nWhen I first wanted to add my domain mitlaender.dev / www.mitlaender.dev it kept only giving me a self-signed certificate. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t work considering I\u0026rsquo;m using .dev as my Top-Level-Domain (TLD).\nSo what was my Problem \u0026amp; Solution?\u003e\rSo what was my Problem \u0026amp; Solution? # I had to change Domain Registrar for some reason. For whatever reason it is, IONOS blocks DNSSEC behind an \u0026ldquo;additional Service\u0026rdquo; and I wasnt really willing to pay for that, considering that I\u0026rsquo;ve only had clunky experiences with their system at best, I thought it was time to change registrar and see if that fixes it. And it did! I switched to Google Domains (which they hopefully wont kill any time soon), transfered my records, added the needed ones for Netlify (one CNAME for www and a A-Record to their load balancer something something), activated DNSSEC and:\nIt works! I don\u0026rsquo;t know if the problem really was the missing DNSSEC, but as far as I\u0026rsquo;m concerned I\u0026rsquo;m happy that it works now.\nWhat to expect here?\u003e\rWhat to expect here? # So now to end I want to tell you what you can expect here.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll probably try to write about my learning experiences as part of my Computer Science Bachelor and some personal projects. Maybe some more private concerns, like my French learning efforts, here and there but I\u0026rsquo;ll try to keep this mostly to some not too private, more \u0026ldquo;professional\u0026rdquo; things.\nIf you got here I\u0026rsquo;m happy you took the time to read all this, and I hope you got to know some new things or had an interesting read!\n","date":"27 November 2022","permalink":"/posts/271122-making-this-sited/","section":"","summary":"How it started\u003e\rHow it started # So as it currently stands I\u0026rsquo;m just going around, applying for internships here and there (fun little story how hard I\u0026rsquo;m making it for myself - France without french, we\u0026rsquo;ll see how that works out), and I thought it would be kind of good to finally have a better looking personal website, potentially including a blog (See?","title":"How I 'created' this site"},{"content":"","date":"27 November 2022","permalink":"/","section":"Portfolio \u0026 Blog (by Lutz)","summary":"","title":"Portfolio \u0026 Blog (by Lutz)"},{"content":"Who am I?\u003e\rWho am I?

This doesn\u0026rsquo;t only include computer science subjects, other areas like Space are included too!\nMy journey\u003e\rMy journey My IT learning journey starts pretty early on, with both parents active in the sector and growing up surrounded by technology and video games.\nThe first time I remember programming is with ~12 - 14, creating my own little Minecraft server plugins in Java, researching for hours on end on youtube and learning the basics, getting active in some communities and building friendships with some more skilled coders over forums. From then on the journey has been a little all over the place. I proceeded to \u0026ldquo;steal\u0026rdquo; a C++ Book from my father, learning about memory, pointers, and all that good stuff. Got to know AutoIt for scripts and simple GUI programs. Basically, I was playing around and getting to know everything I could.\nThen after 10th grade in middle school I stood before the choice: Do I continue on to High school and afterwards to Study to get to know more of the theory? Or do I serve an Apprenticeship to finally get some practical experience? In the end, it was clear: I wanted both. I wanted to know more but also to be able to work in a real-world programming environment. So what was my solution to this dilemma? A nice little pilot project called \u0026ldquo;Vocational School Plus\u0026rdquo; (Berufsschule Plus), which enabled me to serve an Apprenticeship as a \u0026ldquo;Computer Science Expert in Software Development\u0026rdquo; and at the same time visit an evening school voluntarily, to get my high school diploma at the same time. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t always the easiest but I ended up doing it!\nAnd now here I am, studying computer science at the \u0026ldquo;Nuremberg Institute of Technology\u0026rdquo; while still working as a software engineer part-time.\nMy Skills\u003e\rMy Skills Programming Languages\u003e\rProgramming Languages C# (ASP.NET Core, WPF, My currently most used language) Python (Soon including my universities ML Specialization) C/AL SQL Basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript Miscellaneous Skills\u003e\rMiscellaneous Skills Git Linux Some Docker Agile Development (SCRUM) Databases (MSSQL, MySQL) Etc. like Microsoft Office Languages I speak\u003e\rLanguages I speak German (Native / C2) English (fluent / C1 - C2) ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/about/","section":"Portfolio \u0026 Blog (by Lutz)","summary":"Who am I?\u003e\rWho am I?
